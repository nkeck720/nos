This Git repository contains the source and binary code for NOS.

This README file was created on FRI JUN 19 at 11:36:42. For updates, check this date regularly.

This readme assumes that you have tried the OS without reading this file. I do that a lot myself,
and you really shouldn't as this file contains important information.

KNOWN BUGS AS OF THIS DATE:
- Backspace key works, but teleports the cursor to the center of the screen.
- Screen does not scroll down.
- The keyboard works, but currently unprocessed keys like arrow and home, etc. display spaces

FIXED BUGS AS OF THIS DATE:
+ Fixed keyboard not responding
+ Fixed only spaces will type
+ Fixed stack issues
+ Fixed version display issues
+ Removed Easter Eggs (trying to fit as much code in the MBR as possible)
+ Began development on new file system
+ Replaced INT 10-09 with INT 10-0E

CREATING A FLOPPY FROM THE IMAGES
To create an OS image, first compile the .asm files into their own seperate .img or .bin files (I have
started doing this before I upload now -- your welcome :) ) with the following commands:

$ fasm myos.asm myos.bin
$ fasm int21.asm int21.bin

Then merge the files together to create one image file:

$ cat myos.bin int21.bin > NOS.img

And now you have a bootable image! In case that you wanted to write this image to a floppy disk, do the folllowing command:

$ dd if=NOS.img of=/dev/fd0

This should about cover it.
