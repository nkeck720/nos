This Git repository contains the source and binary code for NOS.

This README file was created on FRI JUN 19 at 13:12:35. For updates, check this date regularly.

This readme assumes that you have tried the OS without reading this file. I do that a lot myself,
and you really shouldn't as this file contains important information.

KNOWN BUGS AS OF THIS DATE:
- Backspace key works, but teleports the cursor to the center of the screen.
- Screen does not scroll down.
- The keyboard works, but currently unprocessed keys like arrow and home, etc. display spaces

FIXED BUGS AS OF THIS DATE:
+ Fixed only spaces will type
+ Fixed stack issues
+ Fixed version display issues
+ Removed Easter Eggs (trying to fit as much code in the MBR as possible)
+ Began development on new file system
+ Replaced INT 10-09 with INT 10-0E
+ Added a header (0xFF80) to system-reserved sectors (such as the MBR and INT 21 sector)
+ Made compilation process easier
+ Added INT 21 functions

CREATING A FLOPPY FROM THE IMAGES
To create an OS image, compile the .asm files into their own .img files. Then comile the image.asm file into
an .img or .bin file with the following command:

$ fasm image.asm NOS.img

And now you have a bootable image! In case that you wanted to write this image to a floppy disk, do the folllowing command:

$ dd if=NOS.img of=/dev/fd0

This should about cover it.
